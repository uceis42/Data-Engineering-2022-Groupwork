Bonoo Indian Tapas,Art from Heart,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110219760321605714336/reviews,5,"This is the best Indian restaurant in north London. The menu is exquisitely varied and the food is delicately prepared. Each dish is prepared as a tapas dish so feel free to order away and really enjoy the variety of food. There is no real protocol, the dishes are served as they are ready. The place is very inviting and tastefully decorated. Roses all around. Very inviting. Service is courteous and quick. Prices are reasonable for the quantity. We keep coming back."

Scarlett Green,meg bishop,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112846450208470690391/reviews,5,"I came here with my partner for his birthday and everything was perfect. The food was amazing, the value for money is great and the food was faultless. We had the bottomless brunch and everything was fabulous - they leave the bottle with you so you never have to chase for a top up, the food can come immediately or whenever you’re ready which is very convenient and they offer it all week! Steffan was also a great host and we look forward to returning soon. He asked what we were celebrating and ensured our desert came out with a candle and sparkler! 10/10 - would recommend for everyone - families, couples, friends, a perfect atmosphere!"
Scarlett Green,Elysha Anderson,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106304996700215627131/reviews,5,"I came here for a bottomless brunch a couple of months ago, and it did not disappoint.

The Ledbury,e e,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101808193932993867327/reviews,5,"Finally, it is reopened. We absolutely loved the new menu. Crab entree, the mushroom plate and the vanilla custard were the highlights of the tasting menu for us. Chef Brett is such a humble and friendly person that he welcomes all his guests seperately and that treats them like the stars of the night, while in reality he is one. His technique, plating and matching choices are all flawless.\\nThe staff’s approach to the guests is also worth noting; disciplined but genuinely welcoming at the same time. In brief, we are so glad to see Ledbury back to London’s fine dining scene."
The Ledbury,Rachel Skilbeck,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103625009866270956815/reviews,5,My husband and I had dinner Feb 3rd for our anniversary.

Fishcotheque,John Newman,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105283060823248785746/reviews,5,"One of the best if not THE best chippies in London. Right outside Waterloo Railway Station Main Entrance in London just South of the Waterloo Bridge there. Prices have just gone up again but this only reflects the Plague and Brexit Fishing fiasco with which these politicians seem to be or are doing as little as possible about as also with 400% energy cost rises and so forth globally now worldwide it seems too! but cooked properly in the old fashioned way, proper chips and good old fashioned cooking oil too. Well full up."
Fishcotheque,Laurence Berwick,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110623586043145968735/reviews,5,"Outstanding doesnt come close on how impressed I was when I stumbled purely by chance on the 2nd Best Fish and Chip Shop in London, the name appealed from the start and I was pleasantly surprised that they had a good music mix playing as the name had suggested, located almost opposite Waterloo station, if you blink you might miss it and that would be a big mistake if you want to have a great meal possibly before travelling, I was in the area with my friend from the suburbs for an appointment she had and we hadnt eaten since breakfast, it was already 3pm and we needed a big late lunch, we had a small wait for our food as they cook to order and it was definitely well worth the small wait, my friend ordered Cod and Chips, I ordered Rock and Chips, we washed it down with a Cup of Tea, the portion sizes are huge served on a steak plate, the fish had a crunchy crispy batter and it enclosed succulent juicy fish, the chips were no less deserving and were well cooked and plentiful to the extreme, the decor is eclectic and amusing, a mix of vintage advertising signs and memorabilia to enjoy while you enjoy your meal while you listen to the music tracks playing in the background, I stumbled across this gem by chance and was rewarded by fate for finding a fish restaurant that I know I will revisit as soon as I can even if I have no reason to go to Waterloo, the food and ambience said it all, its rare to find a Great Fish and Chip Shop in London and this has to be one of the best."
Fishcotheque,Keith Hewitt,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116043519600055854587/reviews,4,"Closest to \"Seafront\" fish and chips Ive ever had from the city. Impressed. I expected something a little posher of the building for Waterloo, but I wasnt disappointed by the food. Will definitely be returning."

Amrutha Lounge,jubed,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108374497554031759385/reviews,5,My first vegan restaurant and it didnt disappoint. Packed full of flavours and very filling.

Amrutha Lounge,Kri Kris,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105021957886457025775/reviews,4,"Found this place by chance. Ordered pakora to have as snack.

Definitely visit the place again to taste other snacks and dishes ."
The Peasant,Katharina Bergerhoff,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101631458368812184155/reviews,3,"This place came recommended to me for a great Sunday roast so maybe my expectations were a bit high. The potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, gravy and red cabbage were good, the other vegetables unfortunately undercooked and we tried the beef and the pork roasts: the beef was average (I didnt want to finish it) and the pork so extremely fatty I couldnt eat it - but my partner ate whatever meat could be found among the fat and said it was alright.\\nThe fish and chips on the next table looked incredible though, so maybe we were a bit unlucky."
The Peasant,Rex Melville,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111091235494627258724/reviews,5,"Shane and I were looking for lunch, and the menu outside suggested a good array of classy dishes no dearer than some other nearby pubs.\\n\\nLight streamed through the big windows creating a welcoming ambiance, and we got menus from the friendly waitress as soon as we sat down. She scored extra points from me by turning down the loud nondescript music without hesitation when asked.\\n\\nI chose pork belly with mash and greens from the main courses, and Shane went for the bangers and mash. We werent in a heavy drinking mood so I cant comment on their range of beers and wines.\\n\\nAll the dishes were expertly cooked and presented, and my dish only £15, including veg.\\n\\nThe desserts looked great, but we were were too full, so I had just an excellent double espresso.\\n\\nI must come back often( although I didnt ask if the evening menu is more pricey)"
The Peasant,Maksym Shpachynskyi,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106571011892762266496/reviews,3,"Good pint, not the bad service. But I am sorry for cold dry turkey with uncooked veg and watery gravy 23 pounds its insult almost slap on a face. Want my money back"

Chamisse,K H,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107794082595334949848/reviews,5,"Every single item was cooked with great care and attention to detail.  This is a rare thing.  The mixed grill was so tasty.  You could tell the lamb chop was done to order.  Super fresh, juicy and perfectly pink in the middle.  Even something as simple as a side order of chips was done with care.  Nice texture and crunch to them.  The hummus was also excellent.  Again, a simple dish but all the more enjoyable when its of great quality."
Chamisse,Shelley Z,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117954006589452608674/reviews,5,Gorgeous food and wonderful staff.\n\nWe don’t live locally but we love it so much that we happily make the journey down to Chamisse.

Chamisse,Turcanu Teofana,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104264323271231373139/reviews,5,"The best meat I have eaten in my life and believe me, that’s says a lot about their food.\\n\\nI was with a group of friends and all four of us tried for the first time Lebanese food.\\nThe food was exceptional, the meat very well cooked and big potions of food. The waiter was one of the most helpful and caring person out there, he served us like we where from the family.

EaTurkish,Fernando Villalba,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109278665772551881030/reviews,1,"They dont accept cards and the closest ATM is more than 10 minute walk round trip which is ridiculous, not accepting cards in 2022 and considering you have no ATMs nearby. Also sitting arrangement inside is not comfortable and only one table (but that could be forgiven if at least they accepted cards).\\n\\nFood may be amazing but I refuse to go jump through hoops just so I can pay."

Wolkite restaurant,Pulmu Kuura,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103838732939662368072/reviews,1,"Updated review 26.02.2022. One star because of the extremely rude customer service. I came to eat here second time since my first visit a week earlier was very pleasant. This time the food was good again but the customer service was outrageously rude. When I asked for a side dish, I was told that I am stressing them out, even if I patiently waited my turn while they were talking in phone. Next when I asked more water, I was told that I cant ask water all the time. It is quite unbelievably outrageous if a customer cannot ask more water in the restaurant, or that customer is blamed for asking water.\\n\\nReview 19.02.2022:  Four stars. My first visit. The food was delicious, well cooked and fresh. The customer service was friendly and welcoming, and the restaurant is very cozy. My only objection is that the portions of stews  in the vegan combination dish are very very small, and will leave you hungry even if it should be a main dish and priced accordingly."

The server was very attentive and friendly, when my friend said she couldn’t eat anything too spicy the lady said she’d reassure the chef made the dish less spicier than usual.\\n\\nThe honey wine was delicious and worth trying, not too sweet and nice fermentation. When my friend had a fly dive into her wine, the server was gracious enough to give her a fresh glass at no extra charge. The injera came hot and delicious. The quality of the curries were top notch, with the ribs highly recommended. Am definitely coming back!"

The food was absolutely divine (there were a couple of things I didnt love, but thats just personal preference) and was clearly made with exceptional skill and care, and the crockery/cutlery matched all the dishes. Seeing the chefs at work with Clare overseeing was a lovely touch. The decor was understated yet it still felt luxurious. Id say that even though it is expensive it was worth the price tag."

We are from Ireland and came down to London for a few days. We searched for the best curry house around the area and Indian Lounge was one of the best. We gave them a ring and they accommodated us straight away. They have a good selection wine and pint of cobras. The starters and mains were tasty and we were given complimentary poppadums. The garlic mango chicken was incredible. We asked Chris if we could have it extra hot and that wasn’t a problem. I love to cook and the combination of this curry was excellent. Chris and the staff looked after us from beginning to the end and made us laugh. The staff didn’t rush and let us take their time. I even managed to speak to the chef at some point and he was explaining the garlic mango chicken. To make our evening more special, Chris and the team found it was my son’s and his friends birthday and they provided complimentary cakes to both of them putting the happy birthday song on and all the guests were singing too. They even provided complimentary shots. We had a great evening and we definitely made the right choice picking Indian Lounge. We’ve taken plenty of business cards to recommend to family and friends in Ireland and we will definitely be back!"

Magic Falafel,Fernando Gutiérrez Urzúa,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103889976286260689794/reviews,1,"The reason why I give one star only, is because the cashier guy was rude to a woman:\\n\\nThis woman approached the place and tried to grab a piece of bread? on a tray with the sign: \"for customers only\". The cashier guy immediately told her, in the rudest way, that she cannot grab food from the tray as she is not a customer, followed by \"dont you know how to read? look at the sign\". She responded that she was going to buy product, but not after he treated her like that, to what he responded \"go away, we dont need you, we have other 100 customers\".\\n\\nI am unaware if this woman has done it before, or if there is a reason why the cashier considered she deserved to be treated that way. I can tell you that no one, under no circumstances should be treated that way. It was humiliating.\\n\\nI am also unsure if there was any racism involved, as this woman was wearing a muslim veil and seemed to have a middle eastern accent, while the attendants happily offer free falafel to other (white) women passing by, without requiring them to buy anything first.\\n\\nI dont know if this guy owns the place, but if not, I strongly advise the owners to hire someone else. I dont know the name of the rude cashier, but it happened on 13/02/22 at 1:30ish pm, and in our conversation he mentioned he is Indian.\\n\\nThe food was average, perhaps 3 stars. BTW, the location in maps is wrong, although the pictures and my card invoice confirm that Magic Falafel is the place."

Everything tastes really fresh and delicious and they don’t use ghee which means it is not as greasy as other curry places. Since every dish is cooked fresh they are also very flexible at adapting items to suit dietary needs such as vegan.\\n\\nWe have also eaten in the restaurant and it was a great experience. The staff are very friendly and helpful, always happy to recommend dishes and checking that you are enjoying everything. They also gave us quite a few free dishes to try which was much appreciated and meant that we got to try some tasty food that we otherwise might not have ordered. The portions are extremely generous and we ended up with plenty of food to take home with us, which ended up being enough to enjoy over the following two days!\\n\\nA really great restaurant and takeaway that I would highly recommend."

A real shame.\n\n-----------------------------------\nI think this is the best sushi Ive ever had.\n\nIts a tiny place which might put some people off but its casual and welcoming so no need to worry about walking into a stiff atmosphere.\n\nThe waiter is clearly passionate about the food and very friendly. Feel free to let him guide you as they dont just want to sell you as much as they can. Hell recommend based on your needs.\n\nMy needs are just loads of salmon and kampachi sushi/sashimi and like I said - best Ive ever had. Including various trips to SE Asia.\n\nQuite expensive but cheap for what you get. Cant recommend it more highly.

The dress code is strictly black tie with an emphasis on maintaining the exclusive feeling of the venue. Like the bird itself The Swan is the only club in London to have the patronage of her royal highness, and it is clear to why as soon as you walk through the entrance and witness the exquisite architecture that managed to withstand the Great Fire of London and has stood since the early 15th century. The music played in the club perfectly fits the ambience with classics such as Come on Eileen and Sweet Caroline gracing the dance floor of the exceptional establishment. Critically you must to get to the venue early due peak times beginning as early as 7pm with sizable queues forming from 8pm onwards."

After asking several members of staff where to report this and being sent to different parts of the club in the end nobody ended up helping us and as spoken to in a very poor manner. I am fully aware that personal belongings being stolen doesnt make the club responsible but I would have expected at least a member of staff know how to assist in that situation."

The mixed grill was so tasty.  You could tell the lamb chop was done to order.  Super fresh, juicy and perfectly pink in the middle.  Even something as simple as a side order of chips was done with care.  Nice texture and crunch to them.  The hummus was also excellent.

The vibe is so good here - so many interesting objects filling up the space, each with a story to tell. The owner, Pietro, was around and ended up giving me and my friends a tour - he is so gregarious and welcoming. We sampled three of the dessert dishes, which were all delicious; I would recommend their home made cannoli, which was quite possibly the best Ive ever had. Pietros wife (Paola, I think?) was also very warm and friendly, asking how everything was. Other staff were great too. I definitely want to come back to try their pizzas and listen to some jazz! So good that there are places like this still in London, where so many pubs are quite soul-less and corporate. Would 100% recommend a visit!"

A friend ordered pizzas from here a few days back... not only was it stodge but I felt a bit unwell the next couple of days it was a shame given I recommended this place...! 😥 Better luck next time may be....\\n\\nResponse to the petty response:\\nGood to see how genuine polite feedback is treated here - but not surprised considering responses to other aggrieved customers with combative responses. I wonder how many people have simply put up with bad food/ experience and not fed back given the headache the owners return with. Responder must imagine that everyone (as it appears to be a repeat expectation from main poor reviews) will simply stop their life and get in touch with them after spending time and money ordering not to speak of the embarrassment from recommending this place. Its also gratifying to read other similar reviews to mine (heavy dough/ poor taste / unfriendly service as proven below).\\n\\nGoogle have yet to remove this review so am glad to see the reporting was fairly ineffectual much like the food.\\n\\nLastly, I have yet to even consider of ordering from here again after was left feeling unwell the next day but another couple of friends have (one of them from Naples and he felt outraged) and left an apt review."

We ordered typical Italian dishes - vegetarian risotto and aubergine spaghetti. We received complimentary bread with butter which was a nice touch. Both of the main dishes were finger licking. We even received black pepper and parmigiana from the waiter just like they do in Italy. The service and the food in this place is immaculate.

Le Petit Citron,am m,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107396250985223870608/reviews,5,"Not sure how to review this place. On the one hand weve been religiously coming here for about 3 years since it opened, twice or so a year. The quality and price and service is what kept us coming back. After tonight I felt like all 3 have been downgraded. I still would recommend to come here, the food, setting, and service are still very good. Just not what it used to be. Firstly the meal deal price has gone up by £10 to £35 and It is now cheaper to just make your own three course meal (which kind of defeats the point of the set meal deal). The service is very good still and the waiters are polite , although the tonight we had to ask multiple times for things before they came to and the lead waitress was polite but with a bit of \"Im doing you a favour\" back talk kind of vibe which by the end of the night was becoming annoying. But the worst was that the food was too salty. Not like scream salty but noticeably salty. I didnt finish my starter or main because it was too salty. I would still recommend this place to people because maybe it was a one off, but its probably the last time for me. I put 5 stars because over the years this place was great to us and the family so I think it totally deserves 5 stars :)"

A couple of weeks ago, I brought a friend here for her birthday, and Karim was our server. Let me emphasize, the food is so delicious that I wouldnt care who brought it to me. But Karim ensured our evening was special, taking the time to pair a wine for me, finding my friend the perfect cocktail, and bringing out her dessert with a candle. As someone who has served and worked in restaurant most of her life, these actions were noted and deeply appreciated. I could write an essay about how amazing the menu is here, every dish has perfectly balanced ingredients that are respectful to its origins while simultaneously introducing you to something new. The chefs knowledge, expertise, and passion shines through every bite and Im so happy I get to experience this."

Hopefully it may have even converted a few non-vegans ;)\\nThank you to the staff for always being so friendly and we look forward to coming here again soon :)"

Cafe Van Gogh,Arkadiusz Chabrowski,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116180695388749125777/reviews,5,"Great food and lovely service. It is quite cheap (£8 for a main). Absolutely beautiful building and great garden. The only drawback is that menu isn’t very clear but recommended dishes were fabulous so who needs a menu?!\\n\\nEdit:\\nUnfortunately I had to change my previous review. Staff is still lovely and food is great but when it comes to paying I was presented with options “15% tip, 20% tip, 25% tip, 30% tip or no tip at all”. Tipping 15% left me feeling cheap and under appreciating staff that was really great. I don’t know if management/owners eat out much but London standard is 12.5% service charge and leaving more is a sign of appreciation. In this case I felt like if I wanted to show my appreciation I would have to leave 25%-30% tip which I simply cannot afford (£20 for breakfast?). It is not only about the money you make but also how you make your guests feel. I felt cheap and like I can’t afford to say “thank you”. Not the nicest feeling in the world.\\n\\nEdit of the edit:\\nThanks for your response! I am truly happy that you took the feedback on board. I am changing my rating back to 5 stars!"

Absolutely beautiful building with amazing decor and lots of plants inside, very Instagram friendly if that’s what you’re looking for.\\n\\nWe were greeted with amazing service, and they had great allergen knowledge and where happy to explain everything I could eat on the menu. Everything is vegan (so all dairy free) and they were able to make great gluten free substitutions. Best gluten free bread I’ve ever had in a restaurant. And the vegan cheese, oh wow, It’s the first vegan cheese to fully satisfy this blue cheese lover!\\n\\nMy sister and mum enjoyed amazing warm pastry’s and couldn’t believe they were vegan.

I forgot to take photos I was enjoying it so much. The staff were absolutely delightful. This cafe is at the heart of the community offering opportunity for those with difficulties to gain skills for employment. Also classes on cooking on a budget.

Seemed to be a steady flow of regular locals, and some from overseas, so its popular. We shared mixed dips, and my wife tried the Mousaka, and I ordered chicken, all delicious. That probably wasnt very adventurous,  but it was our first visit, but we will definitely be returning to taste more. House wine is £21/bottle."

My friend had the lamb shank and I must say, when it arrived, I had extreme food envy. It was apparently as good as it looked so will definitely try that next time. The Vegetarian cauliflower dish also got great reviews from my sister. The only slight disappointment amongst the dishes was the cheesecake, but thats because it was a baked cheesecake which none of us really like. The molten chocolate was divine and the vegan pudding was also very tasty. Staff were lovely and attentive, we were there early so it was pretty empty. Would definitely eat there again."

Yuu Kitchen,Courtney Barrett,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113126058826383498886/reviews,2,A nice venue with lovely attentive staff.\nHowever I wouldnt recommend it to anyone as the expensive food portions are tiny so you need to order at least 4 dishes per person for a mains. There isnt much choice and the dishes that were available were disappointingly tasteless.\nIf your eating here be prepared to spend approx £100 per person for a minimal selection of overpriced tasteless food.\n\nIt really pains me to write this review as the staff were really lovely and the restaurant was great. But I have to be honest so its a big thumbs down from me. I will never be returning here.

Greek people visiting it.\\n\\nThe staff is extraordinarily friendly and forthcoming, their Greek coffee (do NOT ask for ordinary coffee if you are at a Greek place!) is just like it should be.\\n\\nPrices are more than fair, food is tasty, and they are expanding to a offer more of a coffee-house feel + more seating outdoors.\\n\\nFinally: slightly off the main-road so it’s very accessible but not too loud."

Absolutely amazing service and prices are reasonably good not expensive. Im so happy we came here the brought out the cake and sang happy birthday too for my girl it was lovely never felt more welcome in a restaurant then I did. Most  of the time I complain about food but this time I didnt complain once the food was so nice the meat melted in your mouth. Best restaurant I went to in a long time.

Mosob Restaurant,Dana Saib,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116953207598103617195/reviews,5,"A delicious family owned restaurant! I crave their Eritrean food on many occasions, dipping Injira bread into a platter of a variety of tastes, from spicy to mild vegetables. I have had different types of Eritrean food, but here the food is cooked by the mother and you can’t get more authentic than this. It is a great place for small parties up to 8 or 10. Or even for a romantic dinner. Too bad I left London it is one of the few places I miss. Their service is also the most friendly you will encounter."
Mosob Restaurant,Cristian Garcia,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110462818384533560842/reviews,5,Mosob is a little hidden gem in the middle of the area. The outside is discrete but inside the atmosphere is cozy and the food is beyond delicious. It was the first time we had Ethiopian food but I certainly hope is not the last

They accommodated the whole family of 7 in one table which I appreciated as it is rare to happen in most of London’s restaurants. The food was very good and the portions were quite big. Tea was delicious and coffees were okay. Few of the scones were a bit dry but many of them were fresh. The staff were welcoming and very hospitable. Definitely recommended to visit and try!

Chez Elles Bistroquet,Nhung Vu,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103854259547050939181/reviews,5,Best french onion soup ever!! Worth coming here just for that alone. Service is great and also recommend the coffee. Prices are slightly on the high side for that area but nothing abnormal for London (it is more like central London prices). They do a dinner deal of 50cl of wine and one charcuterie selection for £14 which is a bargain and the wine was great. Much of the music in the background is from the film Amelie so you will definitely feel like you are in Paris here. Overall great experience.
Chez Elles Bistroquet,Alan Whitbread,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110712845512406001597/reviews,5,A gem of a restaurant. Food was delicious- loved the French onion soup. Great atmosphere and service. Reasonably priced too. Perfect!

I had a warm bread to start which was delicious, a chicken roast and a glass of wine, which in total was tremendous value for money. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was the crown jewel of the roast, the Yorkshire pudding, was super crispy and basically not eatable. That aside, Id go back again."

Khan's of Kensington,Peter Edwards,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110657260257752052055/reviews,5,A delightful menu with a good range of subtly flavoured dishes on offer. Think ‘fragrant and delicate’ rather than hot and spicy. So many other Indian restaurants are high on heat but low on flavour! Lovely busy atmosphere but quick service and very friendly. A good test of a restaurant is how you are welcomed as a single diner. Khan’s will make you feel at home.

Anglo,Camille Philippe,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107901283114842167110/reviews,5,"We had the lunch Tasting Menu and everything was so delicate and delicious. I think it is extremely difficult to use simple ingredients and make something divine but the chef clearly prioritized the quality and the flavors are there. It was so hard to select a favorite dish because they are all unique but the cauliflower with apple and cream was a nice surprise. We really enjoyed the dessert too, feeling like kids again & playing at breaking the top. The staff was very welcoming, took time to explain the dishes and super friendly. We also very much loved the atmosphere (very intimate and good light) and music (we wished we could have saved some of them - these and probably bringing one of their bottle of wines home)."

The meat lacked flavours. The rice also was very simple, salad was minimal. So I won’t go back for the food.\\n\\nThe biggest reason I am deducting points here was service. The waiter did not have manners, the service as such was not great. Felt rude and hurried. Tables are congested even when they have top floor to leverage."

The sommelier was knowledgeable and personable and the wine was perfectly paired (but Im no expert with the wine).  Service was attentive all the way from having my jacket taken for me,  right through to having it put back on at the end of the evening on my way out the door.  We were a table of five and were offered a tour of the kitchen which we accepted,  which was a really nice touch.

The star of the show is the rich and creamy cheesecake which is absolutely delicious. They also serve sea food such as oysters. There is seating outside if the weather allows it but you cannot reserve them, they are first come first serve. Overall, the price is justified with the quality of the food and service in a more relaxed atmosphere and location. I would recommend you visit if you are after a great steak dish and do not mind paying for it."

Bill came to 75quid for 3 people including wine but being tapas we were still hungry. Go the the brood round the corner.. better service, better value for money and very accommodating."

The owner and his son gave a very warm welcome and prepared some good food for us. The chicken and beef shawarma is commendable and met our expectations. He offered us some waffles and sauces to try which was also amazingly delicious. Took a pack of spiced tea  also from here. It has a very pleasant aroma and was very appealing.

It’s a bloody revelation I tell you!\\n\\nSmiles everywhere and a real ambiance of gentle warmth and genuine goodness.\\nThe food is always exceptional so I don’t have anything to add that others have already said- it is always delicious and decently priced.

The roast definitely doesn’t disappoint.\\n\\nNeedless to say the food is good! Even the vegetables that comes with the roasted are very tasty and complimented the meats very well. The portions are good (that’s for the 2 of us). The pork scratching just finish the dish perfectly. The cheese cake is super yummy that my partner said he will come back just for it.\\n\\nWhat I like about it is that everything is very home style. All dishes looks like what you will have at home and the cheese cake is served to you by the server scooping it out from the tray.\\n\\nAlso, our servers are very friendly and professional. Extra points for that (if I can give more than 5 stars)"

It was the best meal we’ve had in a Persian/Lebanese/Turkish/Greek style of restaurant in the UK…ever.\\n\\nThe service was so friendly, the restaurant gave us a delicious soup gratis and the mixed kebab for two was the tastiest and most generous such kebab we’ve ever had.  The chicken was tender and just melted in your mouth.  The lamb mince was exquisitely spiced.

Which results in us being very picky when we eat out. A lot of places in the UK that weve been to have been hit or miss but this restaurant was one of the good ones.\\n\\nThe rice here was the first place weve been that didnt serve dry rice, which is embarrassing for the other restaurants. The meats were tender and the chicken breast was moist and perfectly seasoned. My favorite was the lamb kabob, which was seasoned nicely and not over grilled to dryness that some other places tend to do.\\n\\nOverall Id highly suggest this restaurant for anyone that wishes to eat around for great restaurants in London."

I had one of their all day breakfast specials, the Full Monthly, which was excellent. With 2 sausages, 2 eggs, hash-browns, bacon, black pudding, mushrooms and beans, it’s a traditional English breakfast on steroids! Each breakfast dish comes with a large side of toast and tea. Everything was delicious and the portion was enormous - I was really hungry and still couldn’t quite finish  everything on the plate. The atmosphere is relaxed and casual. The prices are quite fair, especially for London and given the quality/quantity of food. The entire meal with tea was just under £11, which is a great deal in my opinion. Highly recommended."

The ambience of the cafe is cosy (they even had a log stove working!) and the food is excellent.

Theyre not only delicious but also not as expensive as you would pay in other similar  restaurants.\\n\\nThe steak and sides were incredible though. The sides being tasty and well seasoned, as well as the steak being thick and cooked perfectly to my specifications."

May Fair Kitchen,Ben Sern Song,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103211519136451650994/reviews,5,"My partner and I ordered the carpaccio, risotto and chicken Alfredo which were absolutely delicious. Portions were just right and we thought flavours were spot on.\\n\\nWe also had the tiramisu for dessert which was a bit different in a good way.\\n\\nOur server was Eros and he was absolutely the best! He made our dinner more enjoyable from helping us take great photos to even surprising us with a little birthday treat. His service was top notch. We were fortunate to have had such an experience."
May Fair Kitchen,Garfield,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109394287822581150021/reviews,5,"A lovely afternoon tea experience: the staff was very attentive and ensured we always had a drink throughout the afternoon tea (and even when waiting for a friend). Simple menu of tea & coffee options but amply enough for us, we ended up having a hot chocolate, then hibiscus & rose tea, sencha and mint tea. A super sweet surprise at the end was served to the birthday girl, truly an unexpected addition to a great time!\\nThe sandwiches were very tasty, the scones so finger-licking delicious that we were considering asking for an extra plate until we realised we barely had room for the desserts - and it would have been a terrible crime to have passed on those, not to mention the chocolate truffles"

Blacklock Soho,Kurt Clauss,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100390437231133885136/reviews,5,"Decided to try this place out instead of a more traditional fine dining steakhouse and we were not disappointed in the slightest. For anyone who loves steak this restaurant celebrates beef in the best way. We tried two appetizers and both were delicious and rich. The canapes were also very well balanced and well priced. Drinks were very well priced and our group of three had several throughout the night. We decided to try a massive porterhouse and a large sirloin as well, both were cooked to a delicious medium rare. The sauces (we did the house sauce and the house sauce with peppercorn) were not mind blowing and honestly after trying them we decided the steak was better without. I would suggest reducing the peppercorn sauce more and including cream so it is closer to a classic peppercorn. Overall a great dining experience and the service was fantastic as well. if you want a great steak with a casual atmosphere without the pretentious feeling of a formal steakhouse this is a great place to try."
