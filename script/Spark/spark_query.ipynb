The food was amazing, the value for money is great and the food was faultless. We had the bottomless brunch and everything was fabulous - they leave the bottle with you so you never have to chase for a top up, the food can come immediately or whenever you’re ready which is very convenient and they offer it all week! Steffan was also a great host and we look forward to returning soon. He asked what we were celebrating and ensured our desert came out with a candle and sparkler! 10/10 - would recommend for everyone - families, couples, friends, a perfect atmosphere!\n",

We absolutely loved the new menu. Crab entree, the mushroom plate and the vanilla custard were the highlights of the tasting menu for us. Chef Brett is such a humble and friendly person that he welcomes all his guests seperately and that treats them like the stars of the night, while in reality he is one. His technique, plating and matching choices are all flawless.\\nThe staff’s approach to the guests is also worth noting; disciplined but genuinely welcoming at the same time. In brief, we are so glad to see Ledbury back to London’s fine dining scene.\n",

Right outside Waterloo Railway Station Main Entrance in London just South of the Waterloo Bridge there. Prices have just gone up again but this only reflects the Plague and Brexit Fishing fiasco with which these politicians seem to be or are doing as little as possible about as also with 400% energy cost rises and so forth globally now worldwide it seems too! but cooked properly in the old fashioned way, proper chips and good old fashioned cooking oil too.

The potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, gravy and red cabbage were good, the other vegetables unfortunately undercooked and we tried the beef and the pork roasts: the beef was average (I didnt want to finish it) and the pork so extremely fatty I couldnt eat it - but my partner ate whatever meat could be found among the fat and said it was alright.\\nThe fish and chips on the next table looked incredible though, so maybe we were a bit unlucky.\n",

She scored extra points from me by turning down the loud nondescript music without hesitation when asked.\\n\\nI chose pork belly with mash and greens from the main courses, and Shane went for the bangers and mash.

This is a rare thing.  The mixed grill was so tasty.  You could tell the lamb chop was done to order.  Super fresh, juicy and perfectly pink in the middle.  Even something as simple as a side order of chips was done with care.  Nice texture and crunch to them.  The hummus was also excellent.  Again, a simple dish but all the more enjoyable when its of great quality.\n",

The only thing that stopped us from getting 5 stars was the house \"wine\" that was on offer (The Shy Pig)\\nHowever I am looking forward to coming back and trying some other dishes soon... Ive got my eye on their Bhuna for next time!\n",

Also sitting arrangement inside is not comfortable and only one table (but that could be forgiven if at least they accepted cards).\\n\\nFood may be amazing but I refuse to go jump through hoops just so I can pay.\n",

The only thing that stopped us from getting 5 stars was the house \"wine\" that was on offer (The Shy Pig)\\nHowever I am looking forward to coming back and trying some other dishes soon... Ive got my eye on their Bhuna for next time!\n",

For the price nothing special, just pasta and some sauce for 20€. (check photo)\\nIts way too expensive for what it offers, especially concerning this imaginary fees on our bill. We basically paid for mid range, half - full plate of pasta 50€ and then 13 euro for whatever the fee was next to service fee.\\nThere is so many better options around to eat. Better go avoid this one on your trip.\\nPhoto evidence:\n",

Dont be put off from the exterior, it doesnt do the restaurant justice but It is only small so definitely recommend booking.\\nIf you are after pizza go to a pizza restaurant but if you are looking for tasty Italian food then this is the place.\n",

The food was amazing, the value for money is great and the food was faultless. We had the bottomless brunch and everything was fabulous - they leave the bottle with you so you never have to chase for a top up, the food can come immediately or whenever you’re ready which is very convenient and they offer it all week! Steffan was also a great host and we look forward to returning soon. He asked what we were celebrating and ensured our desert came out with a candle and sparkler! 10/10 - would recommend for everyone - families, couples, friends, a perfect atmosphere!\n",

One star because of the extremely rude customer service. I came to eat here second time since my first visit a week earlier was very pleasant. This time the food was good again but the customer service was outrageously rude. When I asked for a side dish, I was told that I am stressing them out, even if I patiently waited my turn while they were talking in phone. Next when I asked more water, I was told that I cant ask water all the time. It is quite unbelievably outrageous if a customer cannot ask more water in the restaurant, or that customer is blamed for asking water.\\n\\nReview 19.02.2022:  Four stars. My first visit. The food was delicious, well cooked and fresh. The customer service was friendly and welcoming, and the restaurant is very cozy. My only objection is that the portions of stews  in the vegan combination dish are very very small, and will leave you hungry even if it should be a main dish and priced accordingly.\n",

We ordered the sharing platter for two. The server was very attentive and friendly, when my friend said she couldn’t eat anything too spicy the lady said she’d reassure the chef made the dish less spicier than usual.\\n\\nThe honey wine was delicious and worth trying, not too sweet and nice fermentation. When my friend had a fly dive into her wine, the server was gracious enough to give her a fresh glass at no extra charge. The injera came hot and delicious. The quality of the curries were top notch, with the ribs highly recommended. Am definitely coming back!\n",

It’s quite small inside with a good atmosphere, very busy, very clean and lovely decor.  The service was friendly and very quick.  Loved our food and will definitely go back to try some of the other delicious dishes we saw others having. 5⭐️\n",

This is a rare thing.  The mixed grill was so tasty.  You could tell the lamb chop was done to order.  Super fresh, juicy and perfectly pink in the middle.  Even something as simple as a side order of chips was done with care.  Nice texture and crunch to them.  The hummus was also excellent.  Again, a simple dish but all the more enjoyable when its of great quality.\n",

Not the first time I have waited over 1,5 hours for my delivery. Called after an hour and they said it’s on its way… 30 minutes later still nothing. They then said they will refund us the money for the two pizzas, the next day I receive a refund of 7 pounds 😂\\nI had a good run with Venerdi, but will go elsewhere for my pizza from now on.\n",

The manager rang during the evening to ask if we were happy. Such a good restaurant 😀\n",

Samuel was absolutely fantastic to deal with in leading up to the event, and Victoria was amazing on the night looking after us so well. The food was delicious (even for a large crowd) and overall everyone had a wonderful time. I was shouting the dinner and perhaps we didnt drink enough (!), but I was so impressed with the value for money! We will definitely be back.\n",

A brilliant place for seafood - and lovely location overlooking the river - but tasty vegan options too. Last week I had beetroot, chicory and candied walnut salad followed by roast onion squash, barley and celeriac risotto. All perfectly cooked and delicious. Look forward to returning again soon!\n",

They were right and didnt disappoint. Chris the waiter is fun and helpful. The food is delivered quickly but you are never rushed. There is an excellent selection of dishes, not all of which I was familiar with. My curry was delicious, well presented and really hit the spot. Highly recommended.\n",

His waitress from Naples was truly welcoming, warm and entertaining. A good selection of wines and great pasta for a wine bar!\\nDefinitely recommend a visit with friends to at least enjoy good Barolo and a cheese board.\\nAttached are just some of the wines we tried and recommend\n",

Delicious pizza (they make gluten free too!) and coffee. We stopped for a quick lunch, but actually stayed for around 2 hours being entertained by a couple of string quartets and a soprano opera singer.

The menu doesnt change much, but whats there is great quality and the drink selection is decent. Nice to have a few non-alcoholic choices on the list for when youre trying to be good. Lots of fish dishes on offer, but plenty to keep vegetarians and meat lovers happy too\n",

It was a wise decision. Kids, my husband and I loved the pastas, garlic bread and especially the puddings. My favourite was the warm apple pie with ice-cream.\\nThe staff was wonderful to our kids. They treated our children very well unlike in many other restaurants where they are always very annoyed by kids’ noises. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the Nonna Selena staff for being so kind to our kids.\n",

The service was friendly, attentive and informative. The food was absolutely divine (there were a couple of things I didnt love, but thats just personal preference) and was clearly made with exceptional skill and care, and the crockery/cutlery matched all the dishes. Seeing the chefs at work with Clare overseeing was a lovely touch. The decor was understated yet it still felt luxurious. Id say that even though it is expensive it was worth the price tag.\n",

It is literally the best thing I’ve ever eaten in my entire life. I’m from Florida and you would think we’d have good and super fresh food, but nothing compares. Absolutely Love every moment here. Definitely recommend this top class service.\n",

I knew it would be lovely but I was staggered. The food is, of course, to die for. The service is extraordinarily darling. The attention to detail is truly admirable. And there is a kindness that is evident throughout. Last year during lockdown I ordered some Valentines chocolates for a special person - they arrived with a handwritten message from Chef and a little bouquet of flowers - more than above and beyond. I am so impressed and cannot wait to visit again. What a treasure!\n",

We are from Ireland and came down to London for a few days. We searched for the best curry house around the area and Indian Lounge was one of the best. We gave them a ring and they accommodated us straight away. They have a good selection wine and pint of cobras. The starters and mains were tasty and we were given complimentary poppadums. The garlic mango chicken was incredible. We asked Chris if we could have it extra hot and that wasn’t a problem. I love to cook and the combination of this curry was excellent. Chris and the staff looked after us from beginning to the end and made us laugh. The staff didn’t rush and let us take their time. I even managed to speak to the chef at some point and he was explaining the garlic mango chicken. To make our evening more special, Chris and the team found it was my son’s and his friends birthday and they provided complimentary cakes to both of them putting the happy birthday song on and all the guests were singing too. They even provided complimentary shots. We had a great evening and we definitely made the right choice picking Indian Lounge. We’ve taken plenty of business cards to recommend to family and friends in Ireland and we will definitely be back!\n",

The staff were nice and the food was great. The downstairs is beautiful By the way. All was good at the beginning however came to pay and the bill was handwritten which is very confusing, dont know what your paying for. The service charge which is %15 was at the top or hidden in the middle of the bill. pretty Conny honestly\n",

I recommend getting the vegan special for two, even if you’re not vegan. The atmosphere is very nice and calm, and the owner is lovely. This is one of the few restaurants that I suggest to friends and go to every few months. Cannot recommend it enough!\n",

And there has been many! One of those rare restaurants where from the second you walk in you feel wanted by the restaurant staff, not like youre a hassle like so many London restaurants. Food was amazing. Absolutely beautiful. Everything we had, starting with simple hummus, to the aubergine, cauliflower, chicken thighs, lamb and zucchini, finishing with the mango baklava. Just all sensational! Will be back for sure!\n",

Great atmosphere, great service. Seating in as well as some out the front. It was a sunny warm day and the front bifolds of the restaurant were open. We had starter of calamari which was good. Then pizza and a salmon dish which were spot on. Would definitely return. There is a deli on the side of the restaurant which looks very good.\n",

The restaurant itself is quite small so I would recommend booking. The portions were reasonable for the price, but could have been bigger. The garlic bread to start was lovely, as was their daily special mixed berry cheesecake (and a very good portion size). Overall a pleasant evening at a good price!\n",

The dough balls with mozzarella are to die for and the gnocchi was delicious and not too heavy. Great personal touch to the service - the waiter Luciano was simply lovely and super friendly.

Veal is one of my favourites. This was my time at this restaurant in Sydenham and it was very nice. Serving staff were really pleasant and ordering was quite quick. My meal with a glass of wine and a dessert was really enjoyable. Small but very well attended place and seamed very popular. While my local in Brockley is closed for refurbishment, this is a great alternative.\n",

Unfortunately not all of it was to my liking but it was still great quality and very unique.\\nWe had been given this as a Virgin Experience gift so had a set menu, but I guess we may have chosen differently if it was a la carte.\\nService was amazing. All of the staff were very attentive and knowledgeable about the food. They all greeted us as we were led to our table.\\nThe restaurant had a great ambiance\\nFood was great quality and cooked to perfection.\n",

Inside was buzzing the moment we stepped in.  The manager welcomed us and quickly cleaned the table himself to seat us. Food was amazing, the chef even brought the food out himself! My kiwi friends said it was like fine dining on a chefss table without the high price. Service was amazing from the moment we sat. We where served by a young lady and a guy wearing an apron . Highly recommend  this place if you are looking for a wine bar that makes you feel like your a local\n",

Service from the start was terrible and hostile, could tell the staff were focused on serving smaller tables. At multiple times when I ordered a beer, I was met with a sarcastic You know this is a wine bar? from the long white haired waiter.\\n2 Hours later... and all we have had as a group is the starter - either some raw lamb or fried cauliflower on a plate.\\nThe main was a steak on a plate, with 2 small bowls of fries to share between 8!\\n\\nWe had another booking at a bar so had to leave as desert came out, almost 3 hours after our arrival. This was a scoop of cream frache with a crumb of digestive on top... Not at all worth £40 a head.\\n\\nTo make this worse, when I asked to rightfully remove the service charge the staff acted as if they didnt know how to and essentially refused. This is something I still want refunded, and Im astounded that service can be so poor and Discretionary Service charge refused to be removed...\n",

The cashier guy immediately told her, in the rudest way, that she cannot grab food from the tray as she is not a customer, followed by \"dont you know how to read? look at the sign\". She responded that she was going to buy product, but not after he treated her like that, to what he responded \"go away, we dont need you, we have other 100 customers\".\\n\\nI am unaware if this woman has done it before, or if there is a reason why the cashier considered she deserved to be treated that way. I can tell you that no one, under no circumstances should be treated that way. It was humiliating.\\n\\nI am also unsure if there was any racism involved, as this woman was wearing a muslim veil and seemed to have a middle eastern accent, while the attendants happily offer free falafel to other (white) women passing by, without requiring them to buy anything first.\\n\\nI dont know if this guy owns the place, but if not, I strongly advise the owners to hire someone else. I dont know the name of the rude cashier, but it happened on 13/02/22 at 1:30ish pm, and in our conversation he mentioned he is Indian.\\n\\nThe food was average, perhaps 3 stars. BTW, the location in maps is wrong, although the pictures and my card invoice confirm that Magic Falafel is the place.\n",

Mildreds has a wide selection of vegan food, and my selection was delicious. The wine was also excellent. The staff were highly attentive and very nice. I had ordered a birthday cake through the website, which was absolutely lovely. They also provided candles free of charge (which was nice as the large cake cost £60).\n",

The lamb chops were so tasty and tender. You cant beat the flavour imparted by cooking over coals. The salad on the side was dressed and this too had a great flavour. We had the chocolate brownie for desert. It was soft, warm and everything you could ask for from a brownie. No doubt we will go back, as I want to try one of the fish dishes.\n",

First time when weve been in the market,  pleasantly surprised.  We stop at Bella Vita restaurant due tot the fact our attention was caught by a clean , heated and good looking terrace. We stayed on the terrace , which has a great vibe , and is actually nice and warm. The food taste and looks great , service was was friendly and warm. Definitely we will return to Bella Vita .\n",

Before it came with DRINK AND ICE CREAM … you have to purchase this separate now.\\n\\nI would recommend this place for couples just because the pizza is nice . I’m sure there is better places for families .\n",

Which unfortunately is not possible but this restaurant gave me a great time. It was a perfect experience. And therefore it is 5 full stars from my end.\\nWhat made our night so great was the food for one but also the karaoke night. We had a blast.\\nUnfortunately we are living in Hamburg, Germany. Yet, if I ever go to Belvedere again I will have to stop by on a Sunday night to have a great time with delicious food at this little restaurant.\n",

Its quite small and perhaps underwhelming, upon entry, but grand and elegant once you begin your experience .\\nThe quality of the food and presentation strives to be of the highest class and the atmosphere is close and personal.\\nOriginality and creativity is what lies at the heart of the menu and the devil is in the detail.\\nFrom the sumptuous char grilled tikka, with a sublime dressing, to the freshly cooked breads through a myriad of coloured, wholly flavoursome dishes it genuinely is a true pearl, in the oyster of Bexleyheath.\\nIf you like big, open dining with grandeur and a pricey wine list then perhaps this isnt your  thing, but, if like many of us you enjoy superb food within a convivial atmosphere then Ill definitely recommend it to you !\n",

Everything tastes really fresh and delicious and they don’t use ghee which means it is not as greasy as other curry places. Since every dish is cooked fresh they are also very flexible at adapting items to suit dietary needs such as vegan.\\n\\nWe have also eaten in the restaurant and it was a great experience. The staff are very friendly and helpful, always happy to recommend dishes and checking that you are enjoying everything. They also gave us quite a few free dishes to try which was much appreciated and meant that we got to try some tasty food that we otherwise might not have ordered. The portions are extremely generous and we ended up with plenty of food to take home with us, which ended up being enough to enjoy over the following two days!\\n\\nA really great restaurant and takeaway that I would highly recommend.\n",

Just went recently (June 2021) and its changed so much. Its not bad now but its just not the same as what it used to be. A real shame.\\n\\n-----------------------------------\\nI think this is the best sushi Ive ever had.\\n\\nIts a tiny place which might put some people off but its casual and welcoming so no need to worry about walking into a stiff atmosphere.\\n\\nThe waiter is clearly passionate about the food and very friendly. Feel free to let him guide you as they dont just want to sell you as much as they can. Hell recommend based on your needs.\\n\\nMy needs are just loads of salmon and kampachi sushi/sashimi and like I said - best Ive ever had. Including various trips to SE Asia.\\n\\nQuite expensive but cheap for what you get. Cant recommend it more highly.\n",

Love the lamb kidney and crispy tongue, the seasoning and texture was absolutely beautiful, and my main course was cooked to perfection, a bit duck liver and the duck breast was unbelievable! Apple crumble with caramel ice cream and clotted cream have made the happy ending. Definitely will visit again!\n",

They were keen to interact with diners but did not at any time slip into becoming too friendly. They were very attentive but we never felt we were awkwardly watched.\\n\\nThe food was amazing, as you would expect at this level. Each course was delivered faultlessly and with an explanation to fully appreciate the chefs aspirations. It almost felt like each course turned over a new page in a novel with a sweet ending.\\n\\nI could say so much more, but do not want to spoil the experience. Highly recommended :)\n",

Wonderful food and atmosphere and you were all so very helpful and friendly. We both enjoyed it so much something nice to remember for my BIG birthday. The card and little gift were a lovely thought and I will keep them although I don’t need reminders. I would certainly recommend it to anyone wanting to celebrate quietly,  a special day. 🤗👍🤗\\nChristine Faulkner\n",

From the moment we arrived, at what was a very busy restaurant, we were made to feel at ease and attended. The food was out of this world, a veal chop cooked perfectly, lamb rump of a flavour and texture that even my fussy mother liked and a great buzz in the dining room. Thank you.\n",

The dress code is strictly black tie with an emphasis on maintaining the exclusive feeling of the venue. Like the bird itself The Swan is the only club in London to have the patronage of her royal highness, and it is clear to why as soon as you walk through the entrance and witness the exquisite architecture that managed to withstand the Great Fire of London and has stood since the early 15th century. The music played in the club perfectly fits the ambience with classics such as Come on Eileen and Sweet Caroline gracing the dance floor of the exceptional establishment. Critically you must to get to the venue early due peak times beginning as early as 7pm with sizable queues forming from 8pm onwards.\n",

After asking several members of staff where to report this and being sent to different parts of the club in the end nobody ended up helping us and as spoken to in a very poor manner. I am fully aware that personal belongings being stolen doesnt make the club responsible but I would have expected at least a member of staff know how to assist in that situation.\n",

This is a rare thing.  The mixed grill was so tasty.  You could tell the lamb chop was done to order.  Super fresh, juicy and perfectly pink in the middle.  Even something as simple as a side order of chips was done with care.  Nice texture and crunch to them.  The hummus was also excellent.  Again, a simple dish but all the more enjoyable when its of great quality.\n",

As we ordered the next tables food was delivered. The lady advised she had requested butter free toast. But the toast on her plate was buttered. Staff removed the toast and placed it in the side in the kitchen. As the kitchen was open to view we then watched them warm the toast and ask it to out plate.  We requested it fresh piece and them did replace.  But food hygiene.  This should have been thrown away not added to another plate.\n",

The vibe is so good here - so many interesting objects filling up the space, each with a story to tell. The owner, Pietro, was around and ended up giving me and my friends a tour - he is so gregarious and welcoming. We sampled three of the dessert dishes, which were all delicious; I would recommend their home made cannoli, which was quite possibly the best Ive ever had. Pietros wife (Paola, I think?) was also very warm and friendly, asking how everything was. Other staff were great too. I definitely want to come back to try their pizzas and listen to some jazz! So good that there are places like this still in London, where so many pubs are quite soul-less and corporate. Would 100% recommend a visit!\n",

Just wow! this will definitely be my regular order, I’m so happy I tried this place! Well done to Monkey Temple, even the onion salad was so tasty. I can tell they take pride in their food.\n",

Only observation would be that I would not want to sit in the center as they have the tables around the wall looking in so you feel on the spotlight all the time! They could do a better job of arranging tables to give everyone a sense of privacy.\n",

It’s a premium place - reflected in the prices, which are slightly more expensive than your standard curry place. But the service is attentive, the decor lovely … and the food? Utterly delicious. And as a bonus, there is a really good outside seated area. So - a place for a treat!\n",

The same quality of food and service you can find in a number of other Indian restaurants within 1Km of this place - Google it. Avoid this place.\n",

I have had sour dough pizza at a couple of other places and never felt it being so heavy or so filling. A friend ordered pizzas from here a few days back... not only was it stodge but I felt a bit unwell the next couple of days it was a shame given I recommended this place...! 😥 Better luck next time may be....\\n\\nResponse to the petty response:\\nGood to see how genuine polite feedback is treated here - but not surprised considering responses to other aggrieved customers with combative responses. I wonder how many people have simply put up with bad food/ experience and not fed back given the headache the owners return with. Responder must imagine that everyone (as it appears to be a repeat expectation from main poor reviews) will simply stop their life and get in touch with them after spending time and money ordering not to speak of the embarrassment from recommending this place. Its also gratifying to read other similar reviews to mine (heavy dough/ poor taste / unfriendly service as proven below).\\n\\nGoogle have yet to remove this review so am glad to see the reporting was fairly ineffectual much like the food.\\n\\nLastly, I have yet to even consider of ordering from here again after was left feeling unwell the next day but another couple of friends have (one of them from Naples and he felt outraged) and left an apt review.\n",

They make a Neapolitan-style pizza that is soft and fluffy but it doesn’t feel gummy/chewy like many can be. Perfect crust with a great selection of toppings.

My favourite eatery in Brixton. The food is incredibly tasty and the juices are packed full of goodness. After eating here you feel nourished and good from the inside out. The guys are lovely, alow time as its all made fresh for you. Sit in the garden and lap up the peace. They grow their own goods and have a community garden out back. About from feeding yourself your investing in local business and community too.\n",

Was very busy not one empty table (it was a Saturday night) which is a good sign in my opinion. You definitely need a booking. They don’t take walk-ins. Food and drinks were great, great flavour and well prepared. Only gave 4 stars because I originally wanted the shrimps as a main and it had sold out so opted for the sea bass which I was really pleased with (highly recommend).\n",

I was really impressed with the service as the staff couldn’t do enough to make our time comfortable. The food was very tasty but I did struggle for options as I felt it was a little limited, however was very happy with what I ordered. The cocktails were really tasty and not served in tiny glasses either!\n",

Its amazing how a small steak can fill you up a lot.\\nWe had an issue on the desert but the manager sorted everything out so efficiently and communicated this back with the head chef.

The service from entering the front door was brilliant, we all felt very well looked after during our visit. The food was the best Ive eaten in a while - our waiter recommended the truffle pasta and thank goodness because it was amazing! I mean it all was, but that dish in particular was delicious.\\nI really couldnt fault our visit. I will be recommending Gloria to others and will definitely be back myself!\n",

Ive still been coming here, this is two years later. Remains the best curry house on brick Lane and probably London. Sahim is an A* waiter. 10/10, genuinely cares about his guests.\n",

The staff made us feel like guests rather than customers due to their rearrangement of the chairs & tables to fit 5 of us in a small space during a busy afternoon. We could’ve easily gone somewhere else, but it’s like a friend who doesn’t let you do anything and takes care of you completely. They were so attentive, polite and genuine.\\nThe food is also amazing 🤩😋\n",

My wife nearly cried after her first gluten-free beer in years. The fried chicken appetizer was spectacular. I had the shirt rib main which I thought was delicious and perfectly seasoned. Top quality food all around.\\n\\nI did not get the names of either of the staff that helped us, but they were incredibly friendly and charismatic.\\n\\nEven if youre not in need of gluten free food, I recommend trying Niche.

Could not fault this place one single bit from the second we stepped in. Everything from the food to the service was impeccable, every single mouthful was an explosion of flavour. The presentation of the food was absolutely beautiful. Timings between food servings were absolutely spot on to allow the taste buds to refresh for a brand new palate.

The service is wonderful and personable - The owner Giuseppe made a real fuss of my parents throughout the night and made sure all the tables were well looked after. They make their pasta fresh every day and it was delicious- and the pizza is the reason I came from other recommendations (best pizza in SW London!) It has an authentic Italian feel with a lovely intimate charm- I’ll definitely be back.\n",

Lackluster food, entirely uncoordinated (20 minute wait been mains arriving for different people), negligible service, very expensive relative to quality. The set menu is more expensive than ordering the same things a la carte. Do not recommend at all.\n",

She has gluten intolerance and all the other restaurants either didnt cater for her allergy or warned it could be contaminated. Terra Rossa was happy to accommodate. The food was brilliant. Loads of choice if your vegetarian or vegan. Well cooked and good atmosphere. Will go again.\n",

We came here on the 8th of March with my boyfriend for a short lunch. The waiter was extremely friendly and provided excellent service. He greeted us and gave us the menus. We ordered typical Italian dishes - vegetarian risotto and aubergine spaghetti. We received complimentary bread with butter which was a nice touch. Both of the main dishes were finger licking. We even received black pepper and parmigiana from the waiter just like they do in Italy. The service and the food in this place is immaculate. We both left full and very satisfied from this restaurant experience. Worth the visit!! Will visit again 😍😊\n",

On the one hand weve been religiously coming here for about 3 years since it opened, twice or so a year. The quality and price and service is what kept us coming back. After tonight I felt like all 3 have been downgraded. I still would recommend to come here, the food, setting, and service are still very good. Just not what it used to be. Firstly the meal deal price has gone up by £10 to £35 and It is now cheaper to just make your own three course meal (which kind of defeats the point of the set meal deal). The service is very good still and the waiters are polite , although the tonight we had to ask multiple times for things before they came to and the lead waitress was polite but with a bit of \"Im doing you a favour\" back talk kind of vibe which by the end of the night was becoming annoying. But the worst was that the food was too salty. Not like scream salty but noticeably salty. I didnt finish my starter or main because it was too salty. I would still recommend this place to people because maybe it was a one off, but its probably the last time for me. I put 5 stars because over the years this place was great to us and the family so I think it totally deserves 5 stars :)\n",

We met an old friend who lives nearby the restaurant. The food was excellent and the house red was one of the nicest wines I have tasted for a long time. The evening was made even more special when our son and his two children arrived unexpectedly and the restaurant staff immediately accommodated them by adding another table alongside ours, all this done with a smile on a busy Saturday evening. We will certainly go back again.\n",

Flavours are simply sensational, neat ambient and bright venue, service is top-notch without being too formal. At lunch you will also have the chance to choose a great value fixed set menu. Fairly quiet atmosphere so it feels like you have landed on another world. A tasting menu is highly recommended for anniversaries or a meal with a very special person.\n",

A couple of weeks ago, I brought a friend here for her birthday, and Karim was our server. Let me emphasize, the food is so delicious that I wouldnt care who brought it to me. But Karim ensured our evening was special, taking the time to pair a wine for me, finding my friend the perfect cocktail, and bringing out her dessert with a candle. As someone who has served and worked in restaurant most of her life, these actions were noted and deeply appreciated. I could write an essay about how amazing the menu is here, every dish has perfectly balanced ingredients that are respectful to its origins while simultaneously introducing you to something new. The chefs knowledge, expertise, and passion shines through every bite and Im so happy I get to experience this.\n",

Initially intended to go to Gloria (just around the corner), yet unsurprisingly it was fully booked. Arrived to this place and I have to say it went way above my expectations. Waited a few minutes to get a seat but once the food started flowing - oh wow. Beautiful flavours, sequence of dishes thoroughly thought of and the cherry on top was the prime view to the kitchen and the platting was happening just right in front of your eyes. What a wholesome way to experience food. Congrats! Keep up the good work\n",

The food is cooked with passion and will blow you away. Id recommend booking the kitchen bar, so you can watch the theatre unfold in front of your eyes. One moves they all move, instinctively as a team. This isnt by mistake, this is a well-rehired play for you the customer. If youre unfamiliar with the wine list or food, just ask they couldnt be more helpful.\\nAlso, ask John about his cookbook!\\nYour struggle to find better food and a better vibe in London. 👏\n",

Gotta love restaurants that just do a few things and do them extremely well.\\n\\nWe had the bavette and the classic flat iron and both were cooked exactly right, served on very cool brick plates, with fun little clever knives (which apparently are often stolen! Who does that??)\\n\\nSides were great too - especially the mushroom sauce and aubergine.\\n\\nThe interior is gorgeous and the popcorn and chocolate ice cream to finish is just an extra hint of smart ownership. People love an extra. Nice work!\n",

This was a birthday treat for me as I had wanted to visit for a long time.  From the moment we entered Daniel and the team made us feel so welcome and at ease.  My wife and I had the tasting menu, and with each course came a story of the food and where it was from, which added to the whole evening.   Juts a delightful experience from start to finish.  Never rushed and nothing pretentious about this restaurant.  Probably the best food I have ever eaten.  We will return soon.\n",

Heard the waitress telling about a couple that are regulars every Friday for the last 10 years. The food was delicious. Visit for our anniversary. Even mentioned in the booking. Nothing special or a dessert on the house tho. The pasta from the valentines menu with langoustine was yummy. Desserts were so light and creamy.Overall will make a 1 and half hour journey to come back again.\n",

Were always surprised at how quickly our food comes after weve ordered it. Especially considering its usually quite busy.\\nI love that its a fully vegan place, but I urge anyone, vegan or not, to try the food here and you wont be disappointed. Hopefully it may have even converted a few non-vegans ;)\\nThank you to the staff for always being so friendly and we look forward to coming here again soon :)\n",

It is quite cheap (£8 for a main). Absolutely beautiful building and great garden. The only drawback is that menu isn’t very clear but recommended dishes were fabulous so who needs a menu?!\\n\\nEdit:\\nUnfortunately I had to change my previous review. Staff is still lovely and food is great but when it comes to paying I was presented with options “15% tip, 20% tip, 25% tip, 30% tip or no tip at all”. Tipping 15% left me feeling cheap and under appreciating staff that was really great. I don’t know if management/owners eat out much but London standard is 12.5% service charge and leaving more is a sign of appreciation. In this case I felt like if I wanted to show my appreciation I would have to leave 25%-30% tip which I simply cannot afford (£20 for breakfast?). It is not only about the money you make but also how you make your guests feel. I felt cheap and like I can’t afford to say “thank you”. Not the nicest feeling in the world.\\n\\nEdit of the edit:\\nThanks for your response! I am truly happy that you took the feedback on board. I am changing my rating back to 5 stars!\n",

Couldn’t have been more impressed! Absolutely beautiful building with amazing decor and lots of plants inside, very Instagram friendly if that’s what you’re looking for.\\n\\nWe were greeted with amazing service, and they had great allergen knowledge and where happy to explain everything I could eat on the menu. Everything is vegan (so all dairy free) and they were able to make great gluten free substitutions. Best gluten free bread I’ve ever had in a restaurant. And the vegan cheese, oh wow, It’s the first vegan cheese to fully satisfy this blue cheese lover!\\n\\nMy sister and mum enjoyed amazing warm pastry’s and couldn’t believe they were vegan. Even the drinks were lovely with  hot fresh apple with lots of cinnamon.\\n\\nAnd I would say all at a very reasonable price for the portions and quality you receive. Will definitely be a repeat customer\n",

And as a staunch carnivore I was a little apprehensive - however I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. I was at a wedding reception and the meal was set with four courses. I forgot to take photos I was enjoying it so much. The staff were absolutely delightful. This cafe is at the heart of the community offering opportunity for those with difficulties to gain skills for employment. Also classes on cooking on a budget.

Very friendly people who have been here a long time. We went at lunch where theres a daily special menu two courses £11.50 plus drinks. Seemed to be a steady flow of regular locals, and some from overseas, so its popular. We shared mixed dips, and my wife tried the Mousaka, and I ordered chicken, all delicious. That probably wasnt very adventurous,  but it was our first visit, but we will definitely be returning to taste more. House wine is £21/bottle.\n",

Our family dietary requirements can be challenging, but Kona hit the mark with each off us. One put veggie, one veggie who eats eggs, one with allergies of eggs and nuts, and me who who will try anything.\\nThe setting was perfect, the staff very attentive and informative about the food when it was presented, and when it was presented, WOW it looked amazing and tasted exceptional. A great fusion of traditional English high tea with an Indian twist.\\nMarvelous, great work from the whole team, and many thanks for a giving us a truly wonderful time.\n",

We did the bottomless cocktail tapas style afternoon tea and it was superb! I didnt get the name of our main server but he was lovely. All the staff were. The cocktails are amazing and they were very attentive in getting you a new one, so you really got your moneys worth for bottomless. The food was really good also. The red velvet cake was my favourite! I really liked the atmosphere, the jazz music really made the place. Overall, fantastic experience and highly recommend!\n",

It was a very nice and unique experience as the tea was done in a tapas style.  The sandwiches were good and we got a cake each (at other afternoon teas these are usually shared).  The cocktails that accompanied the tea were really good.  The ambience of the place was lovely and it had nice decor.  Overall, very good!\n",

My friend had the lamb shank and I must say, when it arrived, I had extreme food envy. It was apparently as good as it looked so will definitely try that next time. The Vegetarian cauliflower dish also got great reviews from my sister. The only slight disappointment amongst the dishes was the cheesecake, but thats because it was a baked cheesecake which none of us really like. The molten chocolate was divine and the vegan pudding was also very tasty. Staff were lovely and attentive, we were there early so it was pretty empty. Would definitely eat there again.\n",

But the overall experience was poor. After 2 hours of waiting for our mains we asked where the food was and we were told that it was \"2 minutes away.\" It took another 15-20 minutes at least. By the time we had paid the bill we had been at the restaurant for 3 and a half hours. They did take the service off and give us a small complimentary dessert to share between 4, but I would have expected a bit more given just how long everything took.\n",

We arrived at the resto for 7pm midway through a bar crawl… didn’t emerge until 10:40! I have never spent so long in a restaurant in my entire 27 years of existence. By the time we were finished, all the pubs were closing, thereby scuppering our pub crawl ambitions.\n",

Was walking around and decided to go for a dinner. Pasta dishes are very fresh and delicious. Deserts are great, not over sweet and the taste is great balanced. Would definitely recommend espresso martini - delicious with a taste of almond. The staff is very friendly and the service was quick.\n",

We ordered the mixed grill and seafood grill, with a mezze platter to share. Honestly the grill plate would have been enough as it came with huge portions! The seafood grill is to die for — amazing grilled prawns, octopus, salmon, calamari, and scallops with a butter sauce and a creamy potato mash. Very reasonable prices and fantastic service as well.

The chef Lello clearly knows how to handle his ingredients and gave us tasty dishes that were very true to the originals. Recommended to those who want to try the amazing flavours Neapolitan cuisine is famous. Really proper seafood, and were definitely going back to try more and more of the specials.\\nStaff were all lovely and discreetly checked in on us throughout our meal, so we felt looked after but never inconvenienced.\\nAndrea was an attentive and friendly waiter who greatly contributed to our lovely experience.\\nThe restaurant has a clean, cozy and relaxed vibe while also being stylish.\n",

The only reason I gave three stars was for the service. The food 5 star the venue 5 star. The service was poor at best I understand being a bar in an up market area comes with certain challenges but bad service is a no go for me. Great place great venue poor attitude\n",

There isnt much choice and the dishes that were available were disappointingly tasteless.\\nIf your eating here be prepared to spend approx £100 per person for a minimal selection of overpriced tasteless food.\\n\\nIt really pains me to write this review as the staff were really lovely and the restaurant was great. But I have to be honest so its a big thumbs down from me. I will never be returning here.\n",

Greek people visiting it.\\n\\nThe staff is extraordinarily friendly and forthcoming, their Greek coffee (do NOT ask for ordinary coffee if you are at a Greek place!) is just like it should be.\\n\\nPrices are more than fair, food is tasty, and they are expanding to a offer more of a coffee-house feel + more seating outdoors.\\n\\nFinally: slightly off the main-road so it’s very accessible but not too loud.\n",

The food here is so tasty and is made exactly how Greeks make it 10/10 food and 10/10 service the people who work here are funny polite and lovely people. Absolutely amazing service and prices are reasonably good not expensive. Im so happy we came here the brought out the cake and sang happy birthday too for my girl it was lovely never felt more welcome in a restaurant then I did. Most  of the time I complain about food but this time I didnt complain once the food was so nice the meat melted in your mouth. Best restaurant I went to in a long time.\n",

I crave their Eritrean food on many occasions, dipping Injira bread into a platter of a variety of tastes, from spicy to mild vegetables. I have had different types of Eritrean food, but here the food is cooked by the mother and you can’t get more authentic than this. It is a great place for small parties up to 8 or 10. Or even for a romantic dinner. Too bad I left London it is one of the few places I miss. Their service is also the most friendly you will encounter.\n",

They accommodated the whole family of 7 in one table which I appreciated as it is rare to happen in most of London’s restaurants. The food was very good and the portions were quite big. Tea was delicious and coffees were okay. Few of the scones were a bit dry but many of them were fresh. The staff were welcoming and very hospitable. Definitely recommended to visit and try!\n",

Worth coming here just for that alone. Service is great and also recommend the coffee. Prices are slightly on the high side for that area but nothing abnormal for London (it is more like central London prices). They do a dinner deal of 50cl of wine and one charcuterie selection for £14 which is a bargain and the wine was great. Much of the music in the background is from the film Amelie so you will definitely feel like you are in Paris here. Overall great experience.\n",

It has a charm to it and the ambience was good. I had a warm bread to start which was delicious, a chicken roast and a glass of wine, which in total was tremendous value for money. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was the crown jewel of the roast, the Yorkshire pudding, was super crispy and basically not eatable. That aside, Id go back again.\n",

Richard and his team deserve all the praise theyve been getting, and then some. Everything about this little gem was great, from the moment we walked through the door and were greeted by a warm and welcoming smile, to the exceptional quality of the dishes. This is a simple no fuss restaurant, serving dishes that wouldnt be out of place in top establishments. Well done guys, We cant wait to be back.\n",

Think ‘fragrant and delicate’ rather than hot and spicy. So many other Indian restaurants are high on heat but low on flavour! Lovely busy atmosphere but quick service and very friendly. A good test of a restaurant is how you are welcomed as a single diner. Khan’s will make you feel at home.\n",

Food seems to be high quality even in other locations across London. Absolutely will eat here again, again. The butter chicken curry is out of this world.\n",

I think it is extremely difficult to use simple ingredients and make something divine but the chef clearly prioritized the quality and the flavors are there. It was so hard to select a favorite dish because they are all unique but the cauliflower with apple and cream was a nice surprise. We really enjoyed the dessert too, feeling like kids again & playing at breaking the top. The staff was very welcoming, took time to explain the dishes and super friendly. We also very much loved the atmosphere (very intimate and good light) and music (we wished we could have saved some of them - these and probably bringing one of their bottle of wines home).\n",

While the food was clean and good tasting it was not the best. The meat lacked flavours. The rice also was very simple, salad was minimal. So I won’t go back for the food.\\n\\nThe biggest reason I am deducting points here was service. The waiter did not have manners, the service as such was not great. Felt rude and hurried. Tables are congested even when they have top floor to leverage.\n",

The food was amazing, the value for money is great and the food was faultless. We had the bottomless brunch and everything was fabulous - they leave the bottle with you so you never have to chase for a top up, the food can come immediately or whenever you’re ready which is very convenient and they offer it all week! Steffan was also a great host and we look forward to returning soon. He asked what we were celebrating and ensured our desert came out with a candle and sparkler! 10/10 - would recommend for everyone - families, couples, friends, a perfect atmosphere!\n",

They added in loads of extras for my evening with it being my anniversary which was greatly appreciated. Would recommend and come back in a heartbeat. Dont give this a miss.\n",

Each course is meticulously prepared and presented.  Decor and ambiance was lovely.  Despite seeking to critique the food somewhere along the way,  it was impossible - everything was perfect.  The sommelier was knowledgeable and personable and the wine was perfectly paired (but Im no expert with the wine).  Service was attentive all the way from having my jacket taken for me,  right through to having it put back on at the end of the evening on my way out the door.  We were a table of five and were offered a tour of the kitchen which we accepted,  which was a really nice touch.  I personally got to meet the head chef and chat through his development of the menu and dishes on the taster menu.\\n\\nA duly earned Michelin star.\n",

Staff were superb and made a fuss of the kids. Food was gorgeous, very fresh tasting and my very picky eater was given her own special non spicy sauce with her rice, which she loved. Definitely would visit again, we really enjoyed it.\n",

They have a range of US and British meat with the usual cuts including larger cuts such as porterhouse to share. The staff are efficient and professional. The star of the show is the rich and creamy cheesecake which is absolutely delicious. They also serve sea food such as oysters. There is seating outside if the weather allows it but you cannot reserve them, they are first come first serve. Overall, the price is justified with the quality of the food and service in a more relaxed atmosphere and location. I would recommend you visit if you are after a great steak dish and do not mind paying for it.\n",

Bill came to 75quid for 3 people including wine but being tapas we were still hungry. Go the the brood round the corner.. better service, better value for money and very accommodating.\n",

Special mention to the chef too who managed to cook the rib medium from my friend and medium rare for me, keeping everybody satisfied. Thank you\n",

So attentive and polite, she knew that we had theatre after the dinner and recommended dishes we could get in order to not be late. The waiter though couldn’t explain the concept and also she weren’t aware of the story about the forbidden rice and some of the dishes. Shef was amazing! Thank you for the experience guys, but staff have to be more informed. We were 40 min late for the table, thanks for accommodating us anyways. Appreciate it.\n",

The owner and his son gave a very warm welcome and prepared some good food for us. The chicken and beef shawarma is commendable and met our expectations. He offered us some waffles and sauces to try which was also amazingly delicious. Took a pack of spiced tea  also from here. It has a very pleasant aroma and was very appealing.

They must only employ Models or actors-because every member of staff is just beautiful-but it’s not beauty. It’s something far rarer.\\nHappy staff, paid decently, in a job they might actually like! It’s a bloody revelation I tell you!\\n\\nSmiles everywhere and a real ambiance of gentle warmth and genuine goodness.\\nThe food is always exceptional so I don’t have anything to add that others have already said- it is always delicious and decently priced.

The green sauce, gravy and almost all sauces were good. from the sides we tried the chips and sweet potato and both were good. I cant recommend enough to try their cheesecake absolutely delicious and creamy.\n",

Have been told that it will take booking 2 mo the in advance to have Sunday roast here. Found this because a video said that this is the best Sunday roast in London. The roast definitely doesn’t disappoint.\\n\\nNeedless to say the food is good! Even the vegetables that comes with the roasted are very tasty and complimented the meats very well. The portions are good (that’s for the 2 of us). The pork scratching just finish the dish perfectly. The cheese cake is super yummy that my partner said he will come back just for it.\\n\\nWhat I like about it is that everything is very home style. All dishes looks like what you will have at home and the cheese cake is served to you by the server scooping it out from the tray.\\n\\nAlso, our servers are very friendly and professional. Extra points for that (if I can give more than 5 stars)\n",

The chicken was tender and just melted in your mouth.  The lamb mince was exquisitely spiced.  The vegetables were delicious also.\\n\\nAll-in-all, we could not fault it and this is the easiest 5* we’ve ever given.  Keep up the good work team.  Can’t wait till our next visit!\n",

My friend didn’t want to eat anything but once the seabass was there, she ate most of the dish closing her eyes. We went back there 2 days after and once again we were treated like queens. The owner and his staff was very sweet and made sure all was perfect for us. Thank you so much! You will see us more times there for sure!\n",

Which results in us being very picky when we eat out. A lot of places in the UK that weve been to have been hit or miss but this restaurant was one of the good ones.\\n\\nThe rice here was the first place weve been that didnt serve dry rice, which is embarrassing for the other restaurants. The meats were tender and the chicken breast was moist and perfectly seasoned. My favorite was the lamb kabob, which was seasoned nicely and not over grilled to dryness that some other places tend to do.\\n\\nOverall Id highly suggest this restaurant for anyone that wishes to eat around for great restaurants in London.\n",

I had one of their all day breakfast specials, the Full Monthly, which was excellent. With 2 sausages, 2 eggs, hash-browns, bacon, black pudding, mushrooms and beans, it’s a traditional English breakfast on steroids! Each breakfast dish comes with a large side of toast and tea. Everything was delicious and the portion was enormous - I was really hungry and still couldn’t quite finish  everything on the plate. The atmosphere is relaxed and casual. The prices are quite fair, especially for London and given the quality/quantity of food. The entire meal with tea was just under £11, which is a great deal in my opinion. Highly recommended.\n",

Knowledgeable staff. Could be more appropriately renamed The Expensive Grape\\nThey should have two prices, one for ordering wine to take away and another for dining in. Takeaway prices are essentially restaurant prices. Plus the wines advertised online are not available as website is not updated regularly.\\nGlad to have a wine bar like Humble Grape on our street though.\n",

Certainly the best one I’ve found. Great food and prices are very reasonably.\\nI ended up eating here nearly every lunchtime when I was working in the area. The ambience of the cafe is cosy (they even had a log stove working!) and the food is excellent. The owners are extremely friendly and prices are better than most of the other trendy eating places in the area that tend to have overinflated prices. Recommendations are the Spanish omelette and the scrambled or poached egg on toast with avocado.\n",

Though I have to admit I think Ill be back for the cocktails more! Theyre not only delicious but also not as expensive as you would pay in other similar  restaurants.\\n\\nThe steak and sides were incredible though. The sides being tasty and well seasoned, as well as the steak being thick and cooked perfectly to my specifications.\n",

Simple menu of tea & coffee options but amply enough for us, we ended up having a hot chocolate, then hibiscus & rose tea, sencha and mint tea. A super sweet surprise at the end was served to the birthday girl, truly an unexpected addition to a great time!\\nThe sandwiches were very tasty, the scones so finger-licking delicious that we were considering asking for an extra plate until we realised we barely had room for the desserts - and it would have been a terrible crime to have passed on those, not to mention the chocolate truffles \n",

For anyone who loves steak this restaurant celebrates beef in the best way. We tried two appetizers and both were delicious and rich. The canapes were also very well balanced and well priced. Drinks were very well priced and our group of three had several throughout the night. We decided to try a massive porterhouse and a large sirloin as well, both were cooked to a delicious medium rare. The sauces (we did the house sauce and the house sauce with peppercorn) were not mind blowing and honestly after trying them we decided the steak was better without. I would suggest reducing the peppercorn sauce more and including cream so it is closer to a classic peppercorn. Overall a great dining experience and the service was fantastic as well. if you want a great steak with a casual atmosphere without the pretentious feeling of a formal steakhouse this is a great place to try.\n",

Love the venue and the food was excellent and really good value for money. 2 steaks sides a few beers half a bottle of wine for a £100, no complaints at all. Not only that, the staff really do make this place so much better, extremely professional and take the time to talk to customers and run through the menu. Huge thanks to our server Cam last night she was wonderful. Think I’ll have to bring the wife here next time we have a theatre date\n",

It surpassed all of our (already high) expectations. The food is outstanding, the staff are extremely polite and the 2 brothers who are owners are incredibly generous. All in all an amazing evening and will definitely be returning with the rest of the family. Thank you so much!\n",

Theres likewise a contribution on the porch right now as well, which was casual, vivid and delicious!\n",

Decent bread too.\\n\\nClean tables and smell free place. Plenty of space and no pressure to eat and go.\\n\\nA must visit for an original full English.\n",
